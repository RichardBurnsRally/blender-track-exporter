### Start Clock [⭳ (zip)](https://github.com/RichardBurnsRally/blender-track-exporter/raw/master/blender-assets/start-clock-lib.zip)

Unzip it somewhere sensible, and in your stage file go to `File > Append` and
select both of the objects. Do not rename them, the game uses the name to make
the countdown timer work automatically.

### Bisanne [⭳ (zip)](https://github.com/RichardBurnsRally/blender-track-exporter/raw/master/blender-assets/tracks/bisanne-blender.7z)

A rip of the native stage Bisanne, which you can use to understand approximately
how the objects should look. Note that this is was produced by the importer,
which does _not_ yield an exportable stage. Nor is this file "perfectly
structured" because all geometry is pre-merged, the ground collision mesh is
separate to the ground visual mesh, etc - so take it with a grain of salt and
ask questions in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/VMySc2fPCH) if you're confused
about something.
