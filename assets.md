### Start Clock [â­³ (zip)](https://github.com/RichardBurnsRally/blender-track-exporter/raw/master/assets/start-clock-lib.zip)

Unzip it somewhere sensible, and in your stage file go to `File > Append` and
select both of the objects. Do not rename them, the game uses the name to make
the countdown timer work automatically.
