## Installation

Just download the zip file, and install it directly in Blender's preferences
pane. You don't need to unzip it. If you had an old version installed, you must
remove it entirely, restart blender, and then install the new version. The addon
should handle migrations between versions when you open a blend file using an
older version.

## Releases

### v0.2.0 [â­³ (zip)](https://github.com/RichardBurnsRally/blender-track-exporter/raw/master/releases/rbr-track-exporter-v0.2.0.zip)

The first public beta release. This is not a finished product, there are still
missing features and bugs to fix, but it's good enough to export tracks.

Requires blender version 3.1 or 3.2.
